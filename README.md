# MicroCityNDS
A port of MicroCity by AzizBgBoss to the NDS, original Arduboy game by jhhoward.

## What did I change?
- Ported to NDS (obviously lol).
- Made the screen bigger (shoutout to jhhoward for making it very easy and accessible).
- Flipped the B and A button for the comfort of the Nintendo gamers.
- Made it accessible for anyone to follow this code and port any Arduboy game (just no audio YET).

## Credits
- jhhoward for the original Arduboy game ([MicroCity](https://github.com/jhhoward/MicroCity)).
- Me for being the goat.
